My life is so successful

I've got everyting a man could ever need

Got a 1000 dollar haircut

and I even have a talkshow on TV

And I know I should be happy, but instead

There's a question I can't get out of my head

What's the meaning of Stonehenge?

It's killing me that no one knows

Why it was built 5000 years ago

Why did the bulid the Stonehenge?

How could they raise the stones so high

completely without the technology

we hava today

When I male my Jalapeños

calamari and prosciutto

I'm the king!

My wife applaud me in the kitchen

when I tell her all I bought is from the local store

When the kids have gone to bed, we're all alone

She gives me a smile

The she plays with my balls

All I think of is Stonehenge

I think about it when I dream

the biggest henge that I have ever seen

What's the purpose of Stonehenge

A giant granite birthdaycake

or a prison far too easy to escape

Stonehenge!

Stonehenge!

Lots of stones in a row!

They were 25 tons each stone, my friend

but amazingly the got them all down in the sand

And they moved it

And they dragged it

And they rolled it 46 miles from Wales

What's the deal with Stonehenge?

You should have left a tiny hint,

when you made this fucking labyrinth

of stones!

Who the fuck builds a Stonehenge?

Two Stone Age-guys wondering what to do

who just said: "Dude, let's build a henge or two!"

I would give anything to know

About the Stonehenge

Yeah, I would give all I have to give

Would you give them your car?

Are you kidding me, of course I would have given the car

What car do you drive?

Drive a Civic, drive a Civic

Drive a Civic!

A car you can trust!

Never mind the car, let's talk about the henge

What henge is that again?

It's the Stonehenge, it's the Stonehenge!

God, it is the greatest henge of all!
